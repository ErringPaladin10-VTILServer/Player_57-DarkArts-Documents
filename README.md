## ABSTRACT
Archives of the history of Script Builders have always been scarce, and even more so
when it comes to the obscure intricacies of the ROBLOX engine. This paper aims to
document all currently known methods of antideath discovered by the Council, mainly
for archiving purposes but also for laying out all specific setups of each method,
especially with more complex ones. Methods, names, details and descriptions were
coalesced from past conversations in the Council group chat, as well as memories of
past usages of these methods way before the Council was formed. Confirmed names
either came from the Council themselves or names given to them by other antideath
creators. Unconfirmed names were taken from hints mentioned in various other
group chats, servers, and accounts from notable antideath creators, and whichever
was most likely to be related to the method was chosen. The list is mostly unordered
at the time of discovery, with some being based more on its category and grouped
with other related methods. Method steps were carefully constructed through
extensive testing, however these may not be 100% accurate, and some may need
further experimentation as will be noted. Most importantly, these descriptions are not
final, and may change as the engine (d)evolves and patches some of them. Ultimately,
this paper was able to provide substantial help to the Council, and would hopefully
also provide help to other antideath creators aiming to dive into the wild world of the
ROBLOX engine
